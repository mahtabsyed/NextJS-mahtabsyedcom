# Full code vs. No Code vs. Automated ML

## Brief Introduction

I have been coding my models using Open-source technologies (Python, Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow) in a Jupyter notebook on Google Colab using CPU / GPU. And now I am trying to make an enterprise grade application using MLOps (Azure Cloud, Azure DevOps and MLflow)

### I had heard of "No Code" and "Auto ML" and I though let's give it a try with same data and compare accuracy of prediction against "Full code" where we have full control of the model.

# Supervised Learning -> Classification

## Brief Introduction

While the term Artificial Intelligence is an ever-growing superset and may mean different things to different people, Machine Learning (ML) which is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is better defined.
In simple terms Machine Learning can predict results based on existing data.
To achieve this, we develop and use ML algorithms (also called models or estimators) and train them on existing data and then test, and finally tune to predict with desired accuracy.

### Classification vs Regression

JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';
function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}
printBasics();
```

And in python it will be

```python
print("Hello World!)

```
